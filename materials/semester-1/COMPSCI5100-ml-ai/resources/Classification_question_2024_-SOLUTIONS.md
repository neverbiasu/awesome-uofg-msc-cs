Classifica(on ques(on  a)   Assume the following training data   in the   two - dimensional   plane of   𝑋 !   and   𝑋 "   is available  (Figure 1).   The target variables for the points in the red and blue are +1 and   - 1. We  summarise the data as   the following tuples:   <(2,0), 1>, <(0,2), - 1>, <(0, - 2),1> , and   <( - 2 ,0),1> ,  respec(vely.  i.   Design   a k - NN classifier with k= 1 and   use   it to   determine the   class variables C 1  through   C 4   for the following test data points:   <(0, 1 ), C 1 > ,   <( 1. 5 , 1 ), C 2   > ,   <( - 0.5 , 1 ), C 3   > ,  and   <( 0 , 0 ), C 4   > :  [ 4   marks]  SOLUTION:  C_1 =   - 1, C_2 = 1, C_3 =   - 1 , C_ 4 =unknown  ii.   What would be the class variable   C 4   above   if we had used k=3?   [ 2   marks]  SOLUTION:  C_ 4   = 1  iii.   Write   down the equa(ons that specify the decision boundary between the two  classes.   [ 4   marks]  SOLUTION:  X_1   –   X_2 = 0 in X_1 > 0. 0   and X_2 > 0. 0   2   marks  X_1 + X_2 = 0 in X_ 2   > 0. 0   and X_ 1   <   0.0   2   marks  b) In the same data set in Figure 1, we apply a linear SVM model   with the predictor  𝑦 ( 𝑋 ! ,   𝑋 " )   for classifica(on.  Figure   1
I.   Which data points   are   the support vectors? Write   down the equa(on for   𝑦 ( 𝑋 ! ,   𝑋 " ) .  (Hint:   First v isually assess the data   to   determine the decision boundary   and   the  support vectors . O bserv e   the constraints for the   margin and   SVM classifier.)  [   6   marks]  SOLUTION:  (2,0), (0,2), and ( - 2,0 )   3   mark,  𝑦 ( 𝑋 ! ,   𝑋 " )   =   − 𝑋 "   +   1   3   marks  II.   Specify the Lagrange mul(pliers   𝛼 ! ,   𝛼 " ,   𝛼 # ,   𝛼 $   for each of the data points in the  training data (2,0), (0,2), ( - 2,0 ),   and   ( 0, - 2 ),   respec(vely.  [ 4   marks]  SOLUTION:  𝛼 !   =   . 25 ,   𝛼 "   =   . 5 ,   𝛼 #   =   0 . 25 ,   𝛼 $   =   0
