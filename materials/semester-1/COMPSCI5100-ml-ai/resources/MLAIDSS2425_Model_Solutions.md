December Diet   2  Question 1: Regression   (Total marks: 20)  Consider using regression to predict the   birth   rate   in   the   US   using the data shown in the  following figure:  Figure 1 .1   Birth rate (per 1000) from 1909 to 2008  (a)   Consider fitting the data with   a polynomial regression of   order   10. Identify the  numerical issue with model fitting and propose a solution with sufficient details  [4 marks]  The value of the year could cause   numerical issues when raised to order 10   [1] , the  numerical issue is   matrix inversion in the least square solution   being unstable when  year^10 is too large [1].   2 marks for a reasonable rescaling method as a solution,  including whitening, min - max, or take the logarithm.  (b)   Consider fitting the data with a polynomial regression   of   order   2 , identify the two  regions of   most likely poorly fitted data points   and explain why.  [ 6   marks ]  2 marks for identifying the correct poorly fitted data points,   several   options:   ( x =1 945 -  1960 ,   y ~= 24 ), (x ~=   1938 - 1940 , y ~= 17 ),   Data p oints   with x range from 19 75   to 19 80 .  4 marks for reasoning:   A   polynomial regression model with an order of   2   is a   quadratic  (or convex) curve   [1] . The global minima of the curve would be in years   after   2008 [1].  The   left   tail end would be   following   the   downward   trend from   1909   to   19 2 0 . [1]. The  curve would   cut through   the drop from 1920 - 1940   and the upward trend after the  1940s. [1].   Option mark {1}: The fitted curve will struggle to capture the drop in 1970 -  1980.  (c)   Consider fitting the data in   F igure 1 .1   with a   liner   regression   model   with the   sigmoid  basis   function:

Explain the choice of hyperparameter   𝜇 #   (mu_k)   and s that could lead to the  following fitted model  [4 marks]  Figure   1 .2 A liner regression model using sigmoid   basis function fitted to the data  Mu_k can be set as x_n [1], and s is set to relatively small in relation to x_n, for  example, 1 [1]. Setting the centre parameter to be x_n gives the model maximum  flexibility to fit every data point [1]. Setting s to be small allows sharp turns between  da ta points to be fitted [1].  (d)   We used two fitting strategies,   namely ridge regression and lasso, and obtained the  following fitting model s   in Figure   1. 3   A   and B . Identify   which fitting strategy is used  in each figure and explain why   and how the chosen fitting method could have  generated the result.   (note, each method is used only once).  [ 6   marks ]  Figure   1. 3 A   Figure   1. 3   B  Figure   1. 3   A is   fitted with   Lasso   [1]. Reasoning:   T he fitted model   has   three   flat   regions.   This  happen s   when basis functions   covering these regions have   zero   coefficients [1] .   The fitted  model   also suggest s   that the hyperparameter controlling the strength of l 1   regularization is set  to be too strong [1 , identifying l1 regularization is needed ].
December Diet   4  Figure   1. 3 B   is   fitted with   ridge regression   [1]. Reasoning:   T he fitted model   is poorly  following the trend . This happen s   when   all   basis function s have very small   coefficient s   [1] .  The fitted model   suggests that the hyperparameter controlling the strength of l 2   regularization  is set to be too strong [ 1, identifying l2 regularization is needed ].
December Diet   5  Question   2 : Classification   (Total marks: 20)  a)   Assume the following training data   in the   two - dimensional   plane of   𝑋 %   and   𝑋 $   is available  (Figure 1). The target variables for the points in the red and blue are +1 and   - 1. We  summarise the data as the following tuples: <(2,0), 1>, <(0,2), - 1>, <(0, - 2),1>, and <( - 2,0),1>,  respectively.  i.   Design   a k - NN classifier with k=1 and   use   it to   determine the class variables C 1  through   C 4   for the following test data points:   <(0, 1 ), C 1 > ,   <( 1.5 , 1 ), C 2   > ,   <( - 0.5 , 1 ), C 3  > , and   <( 0 , 0 ), C 4   > :  [4 marks]  SOLUTION:  C_1 =   - 1, C_2 = 1, C_3 = 1, C_4=unknown  ii.   What would be the class variable   C 4 ,   if we had used k=3?   [2 marks]  SOLUTION:  C_4 = 1  iii.   Write down the equations that specify the decision boundary between the two classes.  [4 marks]  SOLUTION:  X_1   –   X_2 = 0 in X_1 > 0. 0   and X_2 > 0. 0   2 marks  X_1 + X_2 = 0 in X_1 > 0. 0   and X_2 <   0.0   2 marks  b) In the same data set in Figure 1, we apply a linear SVM model with the predictor  𝑦 ( 𝑋 % ,   𝑋 $ )   for classification.  i.   Which data points are the support vectors? Write   down the equation for   𝑦 ( 𝑋 % ,   𝑋 $ ) .  (Hint: First v isually assess the data   to determine the decision boundary and the  support vectors. Observe the constraints for the margin and SVM classifier.)  [   6   marks]  SOLUTION:  Figure   2  Commented [JL1]:   Should the sub - questions be numbered  i,ii,iii,etc? Or for digital exams, is it better to flatten the whole  question so there aren’t sub - questions that don’t show up   nicely in  Moodle?  Commented [AG2R1]:   There is a shared information set in the  preamble of the question. Flattening would ruin this and I insist on  keeping the same structure as it is.  Deleted:   1

December Diet   7  Question 3:   Unsupervised learning   (Total marks 20)  Consider using the K - means algorithm to perform clustering on the following   scenario   Figure  3.1   A .   We expect to form   two   clusters as shown in   Figure 3.1   B .  Figure 3.   3   A:   Original Data   Figure 3.1 B Expected Clusters  (a)   Outline what would happen if we directly apply   K - means with Euclidean distance to  this data. Can it achieve the clustering objective? How will it split/group the data and  why?  [ 3   marks]  K - means clustering aims to partition the data into (k)   clusters by minimizing the  variance within each cluster. It does this by assigning each data point to the nearest  cluster center (centroid) based on Euclidean distance   (1   mark).  K - means assumes that clusters are spherical and equally sized, which is not the case  with concentric circles. Concentric circles are non - spherical and have different radii .  Euclidean distance measures straight - line distance, which doesn't work well for  circular or ring - shaped clusters. Points on the inner circle are closer to the centroid of  the outer circle than to the centroid of their own circle.   (1mark   for identifying any of  these issues )  K - means will likely split the data into arbitrary segments rather than correctly  identifying the two concentric circles. For example, it   might divide the data into pie -  like slices or other non - intuitive shapes.   (1mark)  (b)   An alternative approach is to use   Kernel K - means.   Would kernel K - means could help  in this dataset and why?  [ 2   marks]  Kernel K - means extends the traditional K - means algorithm by using a kernel function  to transform the data into a higher - dimensional space where the clusters become more  separable.   (1 mark)   A Radial basis function kernel would   allow to handle   the   non -  linear cluster boundaries.   (1 mark)  Deleted:   2  Commented [JL3]:   Figure might be better with (colorblind  friendly) colors
December Diet   8  (c)   An alternative approach is to use   mixture models.   Would mixture models help to  better classify this dataset than K - means and why?  [3 marks]  GMMs assume that the data is generated from a mixture of several Gaussian  distributions with unknown parameters.   (1 mark).   GMMs assume that each cluster  follows a Gaussian distribution, which is not ideal for ring - shaped data.   ( 1   mark)  With points only on the boundaries, the model might place the means of the   Gaussians  in between the circles, leading to incorrect clustering.   (1 mark)  (d)   The plot in   Figure 3.2   shows some 2D data. PCA is applied to this data.   Explain how  the first principal component would look if it is overlaid on the plot.   Explain your  reasoning .   ( Note :   there is no need to make a drawing. You can provide a description  of the shape based on the coordinate system provided in the original figure . )  Figure 3.2   2D Points  [2 marks]  First principal component:  The first principal component will be across the direction of   the   highest variance   (1  mark) .   In this case ,   we can note that there is a large variation in   the   axis that connect  the two clusters   (1 mark) .  (e)   Similar to   the   previous question,   explain   what   the second principal component would  look like and why.   ( Note :   there is no need to make a drawing. You can provide a  description of the shape based on the coordinate system provided in the original  figure . )  [2 marks]  Commented [JL4]:   They won’t be able to draw it, right? This is  presumably an in - person digital exam  Commented [JL5]:   Again, I don’t think they will be able to draw  in the exam
December Diet   9  PCA decompose the data into orthogonal components   (1 mark) . Therefore, the second  principal component will   be orthogonal to the first : (1 mark)  (f)   Describe the four - step process you should use to determine the number of clusters in  Kernel K - Means.   (Hint: Each step gets a mark . )  [ 4   marks]  1. Split the Data: Divide the data into ( k ) folds.   (1 mark)  2. Kernel Computation: Compute the kernel matrix for the entire dataset.   (1 mark)  3. Cross - Validation Loop: For each fold, train the Kernel K - means on ( k - 1 ) folds and  validate on the remaining fold.   (1 mark)  4. Evaluate Performance: Use a performance metric (e.g., silhouette score) to evaluate  the clustering quality   and average the results   (1 mark)  (g)   Describe two approaches you could take to managing the curse of dimensionality in,  for example, genetic data. For example, how would you overcome this if you had a  high - dimensional dataset with thousands of genetic features but   only hundreds of  subjects ?  [ 4   marks]  Feature selection can help overcome the problem of   the   curse of dimensionality. (2  marks)  We can use a feature selection method that pick s   the most relevant features (1 mark),  or we can use a dimensionality reduction technique like PCA that creates new  features (1 mark)
