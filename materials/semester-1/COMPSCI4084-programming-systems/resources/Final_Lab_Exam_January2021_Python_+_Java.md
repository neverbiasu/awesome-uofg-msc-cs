Programming and Systems Development  Final   Lab Exam   –   202 1  During the exam  You are not allowed to access any previously written documents or code files from your home drive  or the web. If you do, it will be considered plagiarism.  As in a normal   examination, communication between candidates during the laboratory exam is  strictly forbidden.  Any candidate who experiences a hardware or software problem during the examination should  summon an invigilator at once.  Overview  This exam consists of two par ts: part 1 requires you to write a Python program, and part 2 requires  you to write a Java program. The instructions, allocated marks, and submission instructions are given  below for each part. Note that each part has a total of   24 marks   allocated for corr ectness, as  indicated; in addition,   1 mark   for each part will be allocated for appropriate coding style  (commenting, formatting, variable names, etc).  Part 1: Python  You should write the code for each task below in the same   python source file , as indicated   below.  You should then submit   your source file   through Moodle as described at the end.  Python Task   1a : tkinter GUI   and   Database  Create a program that should display the following screen   [ 4   marks ] :
The programme   should   s ave   the   val id   user name s   and password s   in a database called   Users   when  the Save button is clicked .   [ 4   marks]  It should clear   all   the window s   when the   C lear button is clicke d .   [2 marks]  If a user click s   the button “Display”, the system should display all usernames and passwords   sa ved   in  the database.   [3 marks]  Python Task   1b :   Username and password validation  The system should   not   save   duplicated   usernames .   If a user enter s   a use rname ,   t he system   should  check if the user name   already exists   in the datab a se . If the user name   already exists in the database,  the system should display a suitable message .   [ 5   marks ]
The password should meet the following criteria:  a)   The password should have a minimum of 8 characters .  b)   The password should include numbers .  If the password   does not   meet   BOTH   criteria , the system should reject it with a message saying that  it   does not meet the requirement s .   [ 6   marks]  Python submission  Ensure your submission file   is   named exactly as   it   is   supposed to (i.e.   your _name _ python_task.py )  Go to your moodle account, and submit your file at the appropriate submission link:  Moodle > Programming and System Design > Lab Exam > Python Submission
Part   2 :   Java  Your task is to develop classes to model a world involving   Citizens   and   T raders , where   Citizens   are  able to exchange gems for   Goods   including bread, wool, armour, weapons, and building materials.  All of those goods are provided by   Traders   in exchange for g ems. Every   Trader   supports one or more  Trades , where a   Trade   includes the following information:  -   The price in gems  -   The specific goods that are for sale  -   How much of that goods is available for the price  The following is an example of a   Trade :  -   Trade   1 gem   for   3 Bread  Every   Citizen   has an amount of gems along with an amount of Goods of each type (which may be  zero). When a   Citizen   successfully executes a   Trade , the following happens:  -   The relevant amount of gems is removed  -   The relevant amount of Goods is added  For example, if a   Citizen   initially has 5 gems and an empty inventory, after executing the above  trade, they would have 4 gems and 3 Bread in their inventory. If a   Citizen   does no t have enough  gems to complete a trade, they cannot execute it.  Trades   are provided by   Traders . When a new   Trader   is created, they only have one   Trade   available.  Each   time a   Trader   makes a trade with a   Citizen , a new (randomly - chosen)   Trade   is added to the ir  set. So if a   Trader   starts with the sample   Trade   above, after three successful trades with   Citizens , the  Trader   might have the following   Trades   in their list:  -   Trade   1 gem   for   3 Bread  -   Trade   2 gems   for   1 Helmet  -   Trade   1 gem   for   1 Bread  -   Trade   2 gems   for   4 W ool  (Note that this trader has two   Trades   for the same item of   Goods   –   Bread. This is not a problem in  the system   –   you do not need to check for duplicates.)
Java Task 1: Goods ( 3   marks)  Note about implementation: all classes created in this exam should   be put in the   trading   package.  You must create an enumerated type   Goods   with the following values:  BREAD, COAL, FISH, HELMET, IRON, PAPER, SHIELD, SWORD, WOOD, WOOL  Java Task 2: Trade ( 7   marks)  You must create a class   Trade   representing a single trade, including the following properties:  •   gems: the number of gems involved in the trade (an integer)  •   amount: the amount of goods involved in the trade (an integer)  •   goods: the type of goods involved in the trade (an object of type G oods)  For example, the trade “1 gem for 3 BREAD” would be represented as:  -   gems: 1  -   amount: 3  -   goods: Goods.BREAD  The   Trade   class should have a public constructor that initialises all of the fields, and should also  include the following methods:  •   A complete se t of   get   methods, but no   set   methods  •   Appropriate implementations of   equals()   and   hashCode()   –   note that equality should be  based on the values of all three fields.  •   An implementation of   toString()   that produces a string representation of the   Trade   similar  t o the example above (“1 gem for 3 BREAD”).  Not that you can use automatically - generated code for the   get   methods and   equals() / hashCode() ,  but you will need to write the   toString()   method by hand to meet the specification.  Java Task 3: Citizen ( 6   marks)  Nex t, create a class   Citizen   representing a citizen in the game. The internal details of this class are up  to you; here is the required behaviour.  The constructor for   Citizen   should take a single parameter, an integer representing the number of  gems, and shou ld create a new   Citizen   with that many gems and an empty inventory.  Citizen   should have the following   public   methods:  -   public int getGems()   –   returns the current amount of gems  -   public int getAmount (Goods goods)   –   returns the current amount of the indicated   Goods  type in the inventory. Should return 0 if the   Citizen   does not have any of the indicate   Goods.  -   public boolean executeTrade (Trade trade)   –   should check whether the given trade is  possible (i.e., whether   the   Citizen   has enough gems)  o   If the amount of gems is not enough,   return false   and do not change anything  o   Otherwise, update the amount   of gems and the inventory based on the details of  the Trade and   return true
Java   T ask 4 :   Trader (4 marks)  Create a class   Trader   representing a trader in the world. As with   Citizen , the internal details of this  class are up to you; here is the required beh aviour.  The constructor for   Trader   should take no parameters, and should create a   Trader   with a single,  randomly - chosen   Trade .  Trader   should have the following   public   methods:  -   public List<Trade> getTrades()   –   returns the current list of   Trades   supported b y this   Trader  -   public void addRandomTrade()   –   adds a new, randomly - chosen   Trade   to the list. The   Trade  should be generated with the following constraints:  o   The value for   gems   should be between 1 and 5 (inclusive)  o   The value for   amount   should be between 1 and   5 (inclusive)  o   The value for   Goods   should be randomly chosen from the values of the   Goods   enum  To generate a random number, you can use the   java.util.Random   class, as follows:  -   Creating an object:   Random rand = new Random();  -   Later on in the code, when you need a number:   int value = rand.nextInt(n);   will return a  number between 0 and (n - 1), inclusive  Task 5: Trade.execute() ( 4   marks)  In your   Trade   class, implement one additional public method, as follows:  •   public   void execute(Tr ader trader, Citizen citizen)  This method should behave as follows:  •   If the current   Trade   is not included in the list of trades supported by   trader , this method  should throw an   IllegalArgmentException  •   Otherwise, it should call   citizen.executeTrade()   with th e current trade  o   If   executeTrade()   returns true, the method should also call  trader.addRandomTrade()  Java   submission  Ensure your submission   files are named appropriately:  -   Goods.java  -   Trade.java  -   Citizen.java  -   Trader.java  Go to your moodle   account, and submit your file s   at the appropriate submission link:  Moodle > Programming and System Design > Lab Exam >   Java   Submission
