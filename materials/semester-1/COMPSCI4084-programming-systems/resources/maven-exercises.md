Maven exerci ses   using Eclipse  VERY I MPORTANT:   IF YOU ARE USING THE LAB MACHI NES TO DO THESE   TAS KS, YOU MUST FOLLOW THESE  INSTRUCTIONS FIRST   TO MAKE SURE THAT MAVEN IS USING YOUR OWN FILE SPACE INSTEA D OF   THE C: \   DRI VE  ON YOUR COMPUTER!!!   (These instructions are not necessary if you are using your ow n laptop).  1.   Create   a directory   M: \ maven  2.   Create a file   in that directory called   settings.xml ,   cut and paste   this exact   content   into   the file , and then save  it.  3.   Now open Ecl ipse , open the   Windo w   menu,   and go   to   Preferences  4.   Expand   Maven   in the window, and click on   User Settings . The window should look like this:  5.   Click on the   Browse …   button besi de th e   User Settings   screen (indicated above) ,   browse to   the  M : \ ma ven \ settings.xml   f ile you created above , and click   Open .  6.   When you are   back at the   User Settings   scr een, press the   Update Settings   button. The "Local Repository"  line should change to p oint to   M: \ maven \ repository   instead   of whate ver it was before.  <settings   xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0"  xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema - instance"  xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/SETTINGS/1.0.0  ht tps://maven.apache.org/xsd/settings - 1.0.0.xsd">  <localRepository> M: \ maven \ repository</localRepository>  </settings>  Step 5: click here  Step   6 : click here  When you are done, this  should point to  M: \ maven \ settings.xml
Task 1: Creating a Maven project  Once you have done the steps above, you are read y to create a new Maven project.   In Eclipse, click   File   –   New   –  Other   …   and then choose   Maven project   ( as below)   an d click   Next .  C hoose   Next   on the next scre en too (below).  Choose this  Click here  Click here
On   th e next screen , s elect   maven - archetype - quickstart 1.1   and click   Next .  On the next   screen , give your project whatever   coordinat es you   want   and press   Finish .  Click here  Choose this  Fill in some information   here  Click here
The fin al step is to configure the   pom.xml   correctly for the cur rent environment, as the defa ult   version   refers to an  older ve rsion of J ava   and JUnit.   You   sh ould open the   pom.xml   file in your ne wly created Maven project and   edit it so  that its content is   similar to the following (obviousl y, your   groupI d   and so on will be different):  < project   xmlns = "http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"  xmlns:xsi = "http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema - instance"  xsi:schemaLocation = "http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0  http://maven.apache.org/xs d/maven - 4.0.0.xsd" >  < modelVersion > 4.0.0 </ modelVersion >  < groupId > uk.ac.glasgow.dcs </ groupId >  < artifactId > mef8d </ artifactId >  < version > 0.0.1 - SNAPSHOT </ version >  < properties >  < maven.compiler.release > 11 </ maven.compiler.release >  </ properties >  < build >  < pluginManagement >  < plugins >  < plugin >  < groupId > org.apache.maven.plugins </ groupId >  < artifactId > maven - compiler - plugin </ artifactId >  < version > 3.8.1 </ version >  </ plugin >  </ plugins >  </ pluginManagement >  </ build >  < dependencies >  < dependency >  < groupId > junit </ groupId >  < artifactId > junit </ artifactId >  < version > 4.12 </ version >  < scope > test </ scope >  </ dependency >  </ dependencies >  </ project >  Save   the   po m.xml , ri ght click on the project, choose   Maven   –   Update   project   to be sure that your changes   t o the  POM   are reflected in Eclipse.  Note that   if you are on a lab machine, you might need to do the standard project   configuration hack to remove   –  release   from the J ava compiler at this point.
Task 2: Buildi ng your project  You can   run any of the Ma ven   phases   using Eclipse   by ri ght clicking on the   pom.xml   and choosing   Run a s   –   Maven  bui ld   with the appropriate target. F o r   example, you can use this to co mpile t he project, to clean it, or to run the  tests.  Task 3 : Adding dependencies  One of the big a dvantages of using Maven a s a build tool   is that it   makes it very easy to add   external library  dependencies to the code. For example,   we will add the   Apache Commons Collections library to   our project; this  library provides extended collections c lasses and methods beyond what the built - in java.util .collections package  give s.  To   add a de pen dency,   you need to find the   coo rdinates of the target package.   The details of the package are at  https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.commons/commons - collections4 , which indicates that the  nece ssary fragment to add to   pom.xml   is as follows:  <! --   https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.commons/commons - collections4   -- >  <dependency>  <groupId>org.apache.commons</groupId>  <artifactId>commons - colle ctions4</artifactId>  <version>4.4</version>  </dependency>  Add this fragment to   the   dependencies   section   of your   pom.xml   and update the Maven project as before. You  should now be able to write code in your   project that makes use of classes such as the frag ments shown in the  Co mmons Collections user guide at   https://commons.apache.org/proper/commons - collections/userguide.html .  E xperiment with what you can do   with the new   class, and also try addin g other libraries if you want to   do so.  Task 4: Exp lore  The   f ull documentation   of Maven is at   https://maven.apache.org/users/index.html , and   there is some more  documentation   of th e Eclipse Maven plugin   at   https://www.eclipse.org/m2e/ . Try doing different tasks with Maven  and see how it all   works!
