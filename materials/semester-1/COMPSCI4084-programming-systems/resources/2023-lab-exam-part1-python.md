Question   1  Not yet answered Marked out of 25.00  v3 (latest)  Part 1: Python  Problem:  You are required to create a library management system that incorporates a virtual librarian. The user should be able to enter the book details, save, display them, and clear the form. The user should be able to ask the virtual librarian (simulated ChatGPT – do not use API) for a book recommendation and a book publication date. etc). You should write the code for each task below in the same Python source   fi le, as indicated below. Your   fi le should be called  your_name_python_task.py   (replace   your_name   with your own name, like   mireilla_bikanga_ada_python_task.py ). You should then submit your source   fi le through Moodle as described at the end.  Python Task 1a: tkinter GUI and database for Library System (14 Marks)  You are required to create a program for a library management system. You are required to enhance the library management system by integrating a virtual librarian using a simulated ChatGPT. 1. Create a program that should display the following screen.   [5 marks]  2. The user should be able to enter the book’s ISBN, title, author, and year of publication and save the valid book details into a database named   LibraryDB   when the   “Save”   button is clicked. A suitable message should appear when book details are saved.   [4 marks].  3. The system should clear ALL the windows when the   “Clear”   button is clicked.   [2 mark]  4. If a user clicks the   “Display Books”   button, the system should display all book details saved in the database.   [3 marks]  Python Task 1b: Book Data Validation [3 marks]
1. The system should ensure that no duplicate   ISBNs   are stored. The system should display a suitable message if a book with the entered ISBN already exists.   [1 mark]  2. Ensure that the entered   year   is   not in the future   AND   not earlier than 1450   (the approximate year of the   fi rst printed book).   [1 mark]  3. The system should ensure that neither the   title   nor the   author   fi elds are empty. If any of the   fi elds are empty, the system should display a suitable message.   [1 mark]  ISBN validation message   Invalid year validation message  Empty author and title message  Python Task 1c: Integrate simulated ChatGPT as a Virtual Librarian [7 marks]  Chat Window: For this task, you must simulate the interaction with ChatGPT using a local function. The system should connect to the ‘ LibraryDB ’ to retrieve real-time data to answer the user’s queries. (You type in the two questions below, and the system extracts the answers from the database. Example in the screenshots below). The virtual librarian should be able to respond to queries such as: “Recommend me a book by [author name].”   [3.5 marks]  “When was [ book title] published.”   [3.5 marks] You only need to deal with sentences with those two structures -- no other sentences need to be supported.
Python submission  Ensure your submission   fi le is named exactly as it is supposed to (i.e. your_name_python_task.py) Maximum   fi le size: 100 MB, maximum number of   fi les: 1    Files          You can drag and drop   fi les here to add them.  
