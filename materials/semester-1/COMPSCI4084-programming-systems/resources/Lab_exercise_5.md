Sample Financial data (fdata.csv) as it appears in the .csv file: Date,Open,High,Low,Close 10-03-16,774.25,776.065002,769.5,772.559998 10-04-16,776.030029,778.710022,772.890015,776.429993 10-05-16,779.309998,782.070007,775.650024,776.469971 10-06-16,779,780.47998,775.539978,776.859985 10-07-16,779.659973,779.659973,770.75,775.080017  Task3:   Write a Python program to plot two or more lines with legends, different widths and colours.  Task4:   Write a program that will produce the following output.  Task5:   Write a Python program to plot quantities which have an x and y position given the following arrays of x and y values:  x1 = [20, 30, 50, 60, 80]  y1 = [10, 50, 100, 180, 200]  x2 = [30, 40, 60, 70, 90]  y2 = [20, 60, 110, 200, 220]
Task 6:   Write a Python program to create multiple plots.  Task 7:   Write a Python programming to display a bar chart of the popularity of programming Languages.  Sample data   on the popularity of programming languages 2019 according to IEEE: Programming languages: Python, Java, C, C++, R, JavaScript, C# Popularity: 100, 96.3, 94.4, 87.5, 81.5, 79.4, 74.5  Task 8:   Write a Python programming to display a horizontal bar chart of the popularity of programming Languages  Task 9:   Write a Python programming to display a bar chart of the popularity of programming Languages. Use different colour for each bar.  Task 10:   Write a Python programming to display a bar chart of the popularity of programming Languages. Attach a text label above each bar displaying its popularity (float value)  Task11:   Write a Python programming to create a pie chart of the popularity of programming Languages  Task 12:   Write a Python programming to create a pie chart with a title of the popularity of programming Languages. Make three wedges of the pie.  Task 13:   Create bar plot from the following DataFrame:  a b c d e  10,40,39,30,39  80,38,24,33,50  80,36,90,25,44  70,45,30,69,15  25,45,39,30,55  Task 14:   Write a Python program to create bar plots with error bars on the same figure.  Sample Data  Mean velocity: 0.2474, 0.1235, 0.1737, 0.1824  Standard deviation of velocity: 0.3314, 0.2278, 0.2836, 0.2645  Task 15:   Write a Python program to create a stacked bar plot with error bars,  Use bottom to stack the women’s bars on top of the men’ s bars.  Sample Data: Means (men) = (22, 30, 35, 35, 26) Means (women) = (25, 32, 30, 35, 29) Men Standard deviation = (4, 3, 4, 1, 5) Women Standard deviation = (3, 5, 2, 3, 3)
Task 16:   Write a Python program to draw a scatter graph taking a random distribution in X and Y and plotted against each other.  Task 17:   Write a Python program to draw a scatter plot using random distributions to generate balls of different sizes.  Task 19:   Write a Python program to draw a scatter plot comparing two subject marks of Java and Python.  Test Data:  java_marks = [88, 92, 80, 89, 100, 80, 60, 100, 80, 34]  python_marks = [35, 79, 79, 48, 100, 88, 32, 45, 20, 30]  marks_range = [10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100]
