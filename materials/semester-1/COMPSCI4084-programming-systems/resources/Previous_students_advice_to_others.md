# __Previous students’ piece of advice to this year MSc students who are taking the mandatory Programming and System Development course__

- Prepare yourself for programming skills 
- Only 1 week in learning java, don't be too nervous\.
- If you end up with an inexperienced group, don't try and do it all yourself\. Focus on the quizzes, content and just take the group project one step and a time with everyone\. 
- Focus on the prereading and labs
- If you cannot communicate with your team, say it early\.
- They \(students\) should be serious about it \(the course\)
- Be prepared\.
- Try to improve your skill and be confident to code\.
- Make sure the report is flawless and reflects what you have done\. 
- Follow the lecture right from the beginning\. Do extra practice outside the lecture\.
- Not to stop\. Work hard everyday\.
- Do something about JAVA\. If you aren't strong in JAVA, make sure you bring good marks in Python and Linux\. 
- Reading is important for python\. better learn java before you start this course
- It’s very useful to read materials before the lectures and practice more even after class\. Don’t give up\.
- The write up of the group project is worth more than the implementation
- Do the labs before doing the lab exam
- Do the prep\. 
- If you need to freshen up on your programming, it is best to do it as early as possible\. Best to do it before you start your studies\.
- Read on programming principles before starting the course\. The amount of programming knowledge that this course gives is too big for the small numbers of weeks that are given
