Java   exercises   3  Please see the separate sheet about running Eclipse if you are not familiar with the Eclipse IDE.  Objectives  -   Additional practice applying Java concepts   from the slides  -   Practice overriding equals(), toString(), hashCode()  -   Practice with Collections objects and the Comparable interface  Task 1  Download the   text file   words.txt , 1   which   contains one word per line , and save it somewhere in your file space .   Your  programming task is as follows:   f or each letter of the alphabet, your   code needs to   be able to   find the   longest   word  that begins with that letter, and the word that has the   most occurrences   of that letter. For example, for the letter b,  the longest word in   words.txt   is   beautifications ; for letter a, the word that contains th e most ‘a’ characters is  adiabatically . If there is more than one word that   is   the longest or has the most occurrences, you can return any of  the possible matches.   The input to your method should be a lower - case letter, and you   should consider upper -   and  lower - case letters   the same   when searching for matches ; that is, the word   Acadia   has three occurrences of   the letter  'a'.  To read the file, you   can use   code like the following   (assuming   that you have   downloaded   words.txt   to   the   directory  /path/to/words.txt ) : 2  List<String>   words   =  Files.readAllLines(Paths.get( "/path/to/words.txt ");  For the above line of code to work, you   will need to import   java.util.List ,   java.nio.file.Files , and   java.nio.file.Paths ,  and you will need t o either catch or   re - throw   java.io.IOException .  You should implement   methods to implement the above two queries , as follows :  public   String   wordWithMostOccurrencesOf( char   c)  public   String   longestWordStartingWith( char   c)  Each of these   methods should throw an   IllegalArgumentException   if   it is   given   a parameter   that is not a lower - case  letter (see the static methods of the   Character   class for   a way to verify this).  Task 2  Create a full class description for a   brick - based building toy   –   c all the class   BrickSet . A   BrickSet   should have the  following properties:  •   A   number   (represented as   an integer)  •   A   name   (represented as a String)  •   A   theme   (e.g., Ninjas, Space   –   represented as a String)  •   The   number of pieces   (represented as an integer)  •   A   retail price   (represented as a double)  1   This file was downloaded from   https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ola/ap/linuxwords .  2   Don't forget that on Windows, you need to write two backslash characters " \ \ "   for every " \ " in the path; for example, to refer  to a file in   M: \ Java \ words.txt   you need to   write it as   " M: \ \ Java \ \ words.txt"   in t he above method call.
You must also define a constructor that initialises the above five fields, a s et of   get()   methods for all properties, as  well as a   set()   method for the   retail price   only.   Also define app ropriate overridden implementations of   equals() ,  toString() , and   hashCode() . 3  Your BrickSet implementation should also have one additional method,   getPricePerPiece() , that returns a   double  value indicating the   price for an individual piece.  Task 3  Using t he   BrickSet   class implemented above, your   task is to use this class to implement a   WishList   –   that is, a list of  BrickSet   objects representing the sets that a particular person is planning to purchase. The   WishList   class will  provide methods for   accessing   the list of sets   and   for adding and removing items from the list .  The internal details of the   WishList   class are up to you; the following sections describe the behaviour of the methods  that you must implement. Note that, depending on your implementation, y ou will almost certainly end up  implementing additional methods and/or properties in   BrickSet   –   feel free to do so if it makes sense for your overall  design, as long as   you make sure to implement everything below.  Your WishList class must have a getSets() method with the following signature:  public   Collection<BrickSet>   getSets()  The return value of this method should consist of all   BrickSet   objects stored in the wish lis t. The   BrickSet   objects in  the returned list should be   sorted by set number, in increasing order . You can use the   Comparable   interface to  indicate what the sorting order should be, and   Collections.sort()   or similar to implement the sorting.  Your   WishList   c lass should also provide two instance methods for adding and removing   BrickSet   objects from the  list, as follows:  -   public   boolean   addSet(BrickSet   set)   –   if the given   BrickSet   is not already in the list, this  method should add it to the list and return true.   If the set is already in the list, this method should not  change the list and should return false.  -   public   boolean   removeSet(BrickSet   set)   –   if the given   BrickSet   is in the list, this method should  remove it from the list and return true. If the set is not   in the list, the list should not be changed and the  method should return false.  3   Note that Eclipse will automatically define all of these methods for you if you want it to   –   right click on the class, go to   Source ,  and then look at all of the menu items that begin with   Generate …   If you do this, be sure to inspec t the automatically generated  methods to be sure that they function properly.
