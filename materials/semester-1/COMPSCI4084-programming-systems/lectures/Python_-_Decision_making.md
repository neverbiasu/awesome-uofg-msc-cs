If statements
Allow your programme to make a decision and change the route that is taken through the programme.
The first line of the if statement will test the condition, and if that condition is met (if the first condition is 
True
) then the line of code directly below it are run. If it is not met (the first condition is 
False
) it will test the second condition, if there is one, and so on.
The if statement’s condition often includes a relational operator that compares two values, variables or expressions.
A Boolean expression is an expression that evaluates to either 
True 
or 
False
Logical operators 
combine
 
while comparison operators
 
compare
.

Both conditions must be met

Either condition must be met

Reverses the truth of a Boolean
 expression

If-Else                If – 
Elif
 - Else
If – Else
If number1 is over 20, it will display the message “This is over 20”, otherwise it will display the message “This is below 20”
	
If – 
Elif
 – Else
If number1 is over 20, it will display the message “This is over 20”, otherwise it will check the next condition. If number1 is equal to 20, it will display the message “This is equal to 20”. Otherwise, it will display the message “This is below 20”. The 
else 
at the end is optional. When 
else
 is included, the statement will select 
exactly
 one of several options. When 
else
 is not present, the statement selects 
at most 
one of several options.

Nested If statements
The first line asks a user to enter a number that is saved in variable called number1.
If number1 is 20 or more then it will test another if statement to see if number1 is less than or equal to 50. If it is, it will print the message that is in the variable called result “This is between 20 and 50”. 
If number1 is not less than or equal to 50, the message will be “this is over 50”. 
If number1 is not over 20, it will display the message “This is below 20

If-Else statement with comparison and logic operators 
This code uses the 
or
 operator to determine whether or not a value entered by the user is one of the first 5 prime number. The 
and
 
and
 
not
 operators can be used in a similar manner when constructing a complex condition
