Introduction to Basic Python Usage and Functions

Python Syntax
Indentation is crucial in Python.
Python uses statements and expressions to perform operations.
Example
:
    x = 5
    if x > 2:
        print('x is greater than 2')

Variables and Data Types
Variables store data values.
Common data types: int, float, str, bool, list, dict.
person 
is a 
dict
. Dictionary (
dict
) is a collection of key-value pairs, where each key is unique and maps to a value.
name
 is a 
str
 (String). A string is a sequence of characters and is used to represent text in Python
age
 is an 
int
 (Integer). Integers in Python are whole numbers, and they can be positive, negative, or zero.
height
 is a 
float
 (Floating Point Number). Floats in Python are numbers that contain a decimal point, and they are used to represent fractional numbers.
is_student
 
is a 
bool
 (Boolean). Booleans in Python can only have one of two values: True or False. They are used to represent truth values and are commonly used in conditional statements

Arithmetic Operators
Arithmetic operators are used to perform mathematical operations between two or more values.
+ (Addition)
: Adds two numbers together.
Example: 5 + 3 results in 8.
- (Subtraction): 
Subtracts the right operand from the left operand.
Example: 10 - 4 results in 6.
* (Multiplication): 
Multiplies two numbers together.
Example: 6 * 7 results in 42.
/ (Division): 
Divides the left operand by the right operand, resulting in a float.
Example: 10 / 3 results in 3.3333....
// (Floor Division): 
Divides the left operand by the right operand and returns the largest integer less than or equal to the result.
Example: 10 // 3 results in 3.
% (Modulus): 
Returns the remainder when the left operand is divided by the right operand.
Example: 10 % 3 results in 1.
** (Exponentiation): 
Raises the left operand to the power of the right operand.
Example: 2 ** 3 results in 8 (2 raised to the power of 3).

Example Arithmetic Operators

Comparison Operators
Comparison operators are used to compare two values and return a 
boolean
 (True or False).
== 
(Equal to)
:
 
Returns True if the two operands are equal.
Example: 5 == 5 results in True.
!=
 
(Not equal to): 
Returns True if the two operands are not equal.
Example: 5 != 3 results in True.
> 
(Greater than)
: Returns True if the left operand is greater than the right operand.
Example: 7 > 5 results in True.
< 
(Less than): 
Returns True if the left operand is less than the right operand.
Example: 3 < 8 results in True.
>= 
(Greater than or equal to): 
Returns True if the left operand is greater than or equal to the right operand.
Example: 5 >= 5 results in True.
<= 
(Less than or equal to)
: Returns True if the left operand is less than or equal to the right operand.
Example: 4 <= 6 results in True.

Comparison Operators

Logical Operators
Logical operators are used to combine conditional statements.
and
: Returns True if both statements are True.
Example: True and False results in False.
or
: Returns True if at least one of the statements is True.
Example: True or False results in True.
not
: Reverses the 
boolean
 value.
Example: not True results in False.

Input and Output
For interacting with users and displaying information.
Use input() to get user input.
Use print() to display output.
The 
input("What is your name? ") 
prompts the user with the text "What is your name? ". The user's input is stored as a string in the variable name.
The 
print() 
function is then used to display a greeting message that includes the user's name.
Even if the user types a number, the input is still treated as a string. To perform arithmetic operations, you must convert it to an integer 
int() 
or a float.
The result is converted back to a string using 
str() 
before being concatenated and displayed with 
print().

Input and Output
input().split() 
allows the user to enter multiple values separated by a space. It splits the input string into a list of substrings. 
These values are then converted to integers and summed.
sep
: This parameter changes the separator between items in a single 
print() 
call. By default, it is a space.
end
: This parameter changes what is printed at the end of the 
print() 
call. By default, it is a newline, but you can change it to a space or anything else.

Comments and Documentation
Single-line
 comments start with 
#
.
Multi-line comments use 
'''
 or 
"""
.

Defining and Calling Functions
A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. 
Functions help in 
organising
 code, making it more modular, and reducing repetition. 
They can take inputs, process them, and return a result
def: 
This keyword is used to start the function definition.
function_name
: 
The name you give to your function. It should be descriptive of what the function does.
parameters: 
Inputs to the function (optional). You can have zero, one, or more parameters.
statements: 
The block of code that runs when the function is called. This is indented to signify that it's part of the function.

Functions with Multiple Parameters /Return values
Function Definition:
def add(a, b): 
defines a function that takes two parameters, 
a 
and 
b
.
Inside the function, the 
result
 is calculated by adding 
a
 and 
b
.
The function then prints the result using 
print()
.
Function Calls:
add(5, 3) 
calls the function with
 5 
and 
3
 as arguments, resulting in the output The sum of 
5
 and
 3 
is 
8
.
add(10, 20) 
calls the function with 
10
 and 
20
 as arguments, resulting in the output 
The sum of 10 and 20 is 30
.
Function Definition:
def multiply(a, b): 
defines a function that takes two parameters, a and b.
The function returns the product of a and b using the 
return
 statement.
Function Call and Return Value:
multiply(4, 5) 
calls the function with 4 and 5 as arguments, and the function returns 20.
The returned value (
20
) is stored in the variable result.
The 
print() 
function then outputs 
The product of 4 and 5 is 20.

Functions with Default Parameters
You can define functions with default parameter values. If no argument is provided for that parameter when the function is called, the default value is used.
Function Definition:
def greet(name='Guest'): 
defines a function with a default parameter 
name
 set to 
'Guestâ€™
.
If the function is called without providing an argument, 
name
 will default to 
'Guestâ€™.
Function Calls:
greet() 
calls the function without any arguments, so it uses the default value and prints 
Hello, Guest!.
greet('Charlie') 
calls the function with the argument 
'Charlie'
, so it prints 
Hello, Charlie!.

Scope of Variables
Variables defined inside a function (
local variables
) are only accessible within that function. 
Variables defined outside any function (
global variables
) are accessible throughout the code.
Global Variable:
x = 10 defines a global variable x.
Local Variable:
Inside the function 
foo()
, 
x = 5 
defines a local variable 
x 
that shadows the global 
x 
within the function scope.
Inside the function, 
x
 is 
5
, but outside the function, 
x 
remains 
10
.
The term 
"shadowing" 
in programming refers to the situation where a local variable in a function has the same name as a global variable. 
When this happens, the local variable "shadows" or hides the global variable within the scope of the function. 
This means that inside the function, any reference to that variable name will refer to the local variable, not the global one.
